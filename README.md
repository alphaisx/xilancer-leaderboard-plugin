### Rank Setup
*Make sure is setup is done before moving to the next one*
1. After adding plugin to the system (make sure migration is successful run and validate if plugin is working) 
2. Remember to publish asset files ```php artisan vendor:publish --tag=rank-assets```
3. After that navigate to ```https://gigafro.com/admin/plugins/menu/all``` and edit the default menu, add new custom link(url and link text) in order to map the frontend route to the menu where neede.

**That Ends the Leaderboard Setup**
